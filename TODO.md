# Priority list

This page will hold any future addition to the repo, and it will follow a priority based approach. Priority level should fit into two categories. Pre Release, and post Release.
## Pre Release
- `alpha`: todo items with a priority level of alpha must be completed prior to releasing the site to the company. Any item must be considered of highest priority and be completed as soon as possible.
- `beta`: todo items with a priority level of beta are still considered important, but the site can be shipped and officially released to the company prior to their resolution. Items not completed prior to the release of the site will fall back into the `post release` category.
## Post Release
- `high`: these items should be completed as soon as possible.
- `medium`: these items will hold a lesser urgency compared to `high`.
- `low`: these items will hold the least urgency amongst the three `post release` levels.

## Current State

The project is currently in pre release state, so any todo item is to be prioritised following the `pre release` priority values.
